Janet's Lines:

  Intro

    Hey! It's me,
    Janet! From
    "Janet, Janet!"
    Surely you've
    heard of my
    band?

    We're playing
    by Lake Selene
    for the full
    moon. But it
    gets very cold
    there!

    Could you brew
    us a potion
    that will
    warm us up
    and help
    us glow
    on stage?

  Mistake

    Hm... No,
    I don't
    think that's
    the right
    potion!

  Correct

    Wow! This is
    perfect!
    Here, take
    a ticket for
    the show!
