# Project00 My Favorite VR Place
*This project is worth 10% of your grade, but if you fail the project you automatically fail the course.*
### Due: April 05, 2017 @ Midnight
### Project Proposal Due: March 08, 2017 @ Midnight
Project presentation date will be set no later than April 09, 2017 @ Midnight.

## Project Description 
In this project you will model your favorite VR space to spend time.  Given time constrains you will need to choose the level of detail and size of your effort.  The only constrains are you must be able to navigate the space and you must have three objects that can be interacted with by the user of the VR device. 

## Storyline
Write down a few paragraphs of narrative (250-300 words) that introduce your storyline. Introduce the back-story. Describe what happened just before the action in the environment ‚Äì how did the user end up in the situation they are placed at the beginning of the environment? 

Discuss the elements you plan to use to generate the feelings and emotions presented by the environment. What was the *feeling* at the beginning of the experience? What techniques do you plan to use to change that to the feeling of the experience? Try to describe the setting of your environment. 

What does the user:

- see üëÅ
- hear üëÇüèº
- smell üëÉüèæ
- think üß†
- feel üò≠üòç
- interact with üëãüèª

How does the experience evolve? If your VR experience does not have an actual storyline, jot down the background for how you developed the idea for your piece. What was in your mind? Why do you think your idea is a good one? What was your inspiration? Remember your work will have a storyboard even if you are not developing a narrative type experience.

# Class Project Requirements

There are multiple required components to each class project, which are described in more detail below. Each project will require the following:

- Project Proposal [10%]
- Project Execution [70%]
- Project Report [20%]

The contribution to the final project grade is listed behind each section and each section is required to receive a passing grade for the project.

## Project Proposal [10%]
Projects required some planning, this includes a summary of the project, the goals of your project, and a plan on how you will achieve the goals. [In group project you will have a single proposal for the team.] Proposal should include the following:

 - Title of the project
 - Team members [group project only]
 - Abstract/summary of what do you want to achieve and why, this should only be a few sentences long and will be used to guide the evaluation of the project
 - Resources needed (e.g. Unity and HTC Vive, Google Cardboard and Unreal Engine)
 - Plan on what you want to do with milestones and dates, it can be a simple bulleted list [group projects should have team member(s) identified who are responsible for milestone]

Fill out the [Project00 Proposal](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=kDOH6hyMMUKnmWtaAjWy5nN-1DF_VyVAmx8JZxllOldUNFpXOEU1RjYwQU9HUVVGSDBCU09NRDlSTC4u) form by **Thursday, 03/08 @ Midnight**.

## Project Execution [70%] 
Implementation of project is the execution of the milestones to achieve the project goal(s).  As you develop your project, you will be applying an iterative process that will likely require the adjustment of milestones and goals.  These adjustments should be captured in your projects final report.

## Project Report [20%] 
Report on project, simple summary of effort. [In group project you will have a single report for the team.] Report should include the following:
 
 - Title of the project
 - Team members [group project only]
 - Abstract/summary of what you want to achieve and why, this should only be a few sentences long and will be used to guide the evaluation of project
 - Resources used (e.g. Unity and HTC Vive, Google Cardboard and Unreal Engine)
 - Results of project, how you did with milestones and dates and any adjustments you needed to make.  [group projects should also identify which team member(s) contributed to the milestone]
 - Lessons learned in the project

## Info for Group/Team Projects
- Group projects will have a spokesperson who is responsible for submission of proposal and report.  Will serve as point of contact for team.
- Team members will provide for each team member, feedback will be based on number of team members. As an example, if there are 4 team members (Tim, Sue, Jane and Bob): 
 - Bob will assign numeric feedback for fellow team members as follows, everyone did outstanding job but Tim did the most, he gets 3, Sue did the second most and gets a 2, followed by Jane who gets a 1. 
 - The ratings do not translate to a grade but only reflect the team members view of effort. Numeric feedback is only provided to the instructor.
- In addition each team member should provide a positive and negative feedback for each other.  For example Bob giving feedback on Tim could be, "Tim is a good listener, but always late to meetings." We only improve via feedback, both positive and negative so please be constructive when giving feedback.
